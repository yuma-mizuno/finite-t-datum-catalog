# Finite T-data: structured, interactive document

Open **[index.html](index.html)** in a browser. It is a self-contained offline
document: no server, network request, package installation or external math
renderer is needed. A fragment such as `#r4-c19/mutation` addresses a particular
record and view. Keep it in this repository if you want the relative links to
research sources and the optional print editions to work.

The catalogue contains 385 indecomposable scale-and-shift families with primitive
positive diagonal symmetrizer and diagonal leading matrix: 2, 10, 24, 66, 95
and 188 in ranks one through six. Class numbers form one sequence per rank, across all symmetrizers.
For example, rank six has Classes 1–188 and IDs `r6-c01` through `r6-c188`.
The six identity-symmetrizer rank-two records follow Mizuno's published Table 1.
Scalar multiples of primitive symmetrizers and decomposable direct sums are
described in the [classification document](../../research/symmetrizable/methods.html).
General leading permutations and automatic Langlands-dual identification are
outside the scope.

- **Matrices:** exact polynomial representatives, switching between A and N,
  the primitive diagonal D, both A+(1) and A−(1), and the exact rational matrices A+(1)⁻¹A−(1) and
  A−(1)⁻¹A+(1).
- **Notes:** RSG, SG, Zamolodchikov and other identifications, with the exact
  changes of variables and source conventions. Quiver notes have exact
  mutation paths to Dynkin, exceptional or surface representatives, or a
  witness proving mutation-infinite type. Valued finite classes may instead
  have a complete orbit, with explicit relabellings on every transition.
  Exact equitable SG/RSG folds retain their parent and partition.
- **Exponents:** the determinant formula for the mutation spectrum, certified root-of-unity
  multiplicities, an interactive unit-disk plot, an exact table, a standalone
  SVG figure and an exportable interval certificate. A separate Jacobian
  calculation independently checks all 385 spectra. For nonidentity D the
  fixed-point equation uses D⁻¹A+(1)⁻¹A−(1)D.
- **Admissible lifts:** rational time rescaling and species shifts, checked
  with reduced BigInt fractions; export the transformed datum.
- **Mutation loop:** step through the stored connected-slice mutation word
  and its terminal relabelling, or replay a mutation-class certificate;
  inspect vertices and the exchange matrix.
- **Certificates:** family equations, negative permutations, canonical slice
  encodings, source links, query metadata and SHA-256 hashes.
- **Classification:** expandable statements, reductions, computational steps
  and proof dependencies. The full manuscripts remain linked.

## Data as the durable record

`catalogue.json` holds the entire document's records and structured proof
outline. `records/` provides each datum separately, using stable IDs such as
`r4-c19` or `r6-c188`. `record.schema.json` specifies the version 3 record format.
The class number agrees with the number in the ID. Computational source
packages retain their local indices; `provenance.source_record_id` and
`provenance.source_class_number` identify those source entries. They do not
define a second catalogue class sequence.

`datum.N_plus[i][j]` and `datum.N_minus[i][j]` store an entry as a list of
`[coefficient, exponent]` pairs, in increasing exponent order. Zero is `[]`.
For example `[[1,1],[2,3]]` means z + 2z³. Delays and these two matrices
determine A± completely. The two specializations at 1 are also stored and
independently checked against the constant enumeration.

All indices in JSON are **zero-based**. The reader displays species, vertex
and permutation indices from one. Time offsets remain zero-based. In the
negative-permutation arrays, entry i is the column containing −1 in row i
of the terminal C-matrix. An `old_to_new` permutation sends each old vertex
index to its new index.

The `family` field records the homogeneous equations R x = 0, their original
variable order, a representative exponent vector and the coverage query.
The browser applies r′ᵢ = λrᵢ and p′ = λp + sᵢ − sⱼ with the last shift fixed
at zero, and verifies integrality and the strict row support inequalities.
The theorem identifies these admissible transforms with the entire family.

Lift exports have `kind: "admissible-lift"` and refer to their parent record.
They use decimal strings for all polynomial integers to avoid loss beyond
JavaScript's safe integer range. This derived format is distinct from the
base-record schema. It does not inherit the representative's time period or
mutation certificate: a new period is not computed by the reader.

The stored verification status describes the source's computer-assisted
argument. The UI does not rerun the exhaustive enumeration or the SMT solver.
The connected-slice animation does recompute every displayed mutation and
relabel operation from its exact integer exchange matrix.

## Regeneration and checks

The source of truth is the committed JSON/JSONL under `research/rank3`,
`research/rank4`, `research/catalogue`, `research/higher_rank/rank*/` and
`research/symmetrizable/rank*/`.
Do not edit the generated records
by hand. [Methods and conventions](../../research/catalogue/methods.html)
explains the new certificates; the [research package](../../research/catalogue/README.md)
gives their reproduction commands. The [higher-rank methods](../../research/higher_rank/methods.html)
include the rank-six finite pulse bound, independent replay and slice comparison.
The [symmetrizable methods](../../research/symmetrizable/methods.html) include
the finite weight bounds, complete lift coverage, valued slice comparisons,
source archive and final completion audit.
The build uses
Python 3.10+ and SymPy; the core tests use Node.js 18+.

The research pipeline verifies support, sign disjointness, the full weighted
symplectic identity and the constants at 1 using exact arithmetic. The tests check package
consistency, source and query hashes, all 385 slice-loop returns, the RREF
witnesses, permutations, rational lift examples and arithmetic edge cases.
Source provenance records the latest commit affecting the original research
directories, with a separate enrichment commit and source hashes. A
presentation-only commit does not change those references.

The presentation sources are `index.template.html`, `catalogue.css`, `app.js`,
`core.js` and `proofs.json`. `index.html`, `catalogue.json` and `records/*.json`
are generated and committed. No external runtime is needed to read them.

For browser regression checks, install Playwright (or point `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE`
to an existing installation) and optionally set `BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` to Chrome
or Edge. Run `node docs/catalogue/test_browser.js` and
`node docs/catalogue/test_rank6_browser.js`. These tests include the 570-mutation
rank-six Dynkin certificate and the eight-punctured-sphere certificate.
Run `node docs/catalogue/test_weighted_browser.js` for all 161 nonidentity
records, edge valuations, the dual fixed-point convention, finite orbit notes,
fold links, exports and mobile layout.
The main test opens the document
from disk with networking disabled and saves screenshots in ignored `.qa/`.
